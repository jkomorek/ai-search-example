This is a simple example where all options are known and no complicated logic is needed to expand nodes.

Given the following tree, find the number 10:

            1
        /       \
       2         3
     /   \     /   \     
    4     5   6     7
   / \   /
  8   9 10


The only correct path is: 1, 2, 5, 10
